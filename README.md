* Analyzed financial data from 400 customers to predict loan defaults, focusing on both paid-off and defaulted loans.
* Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including feature extraction, One-Hot Encoding, and transforming categorical features into numerical formats.
* Built predictive machine learning models using classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression in Python.
* Visualized key insights using Seaborn, highlighting trends in customer behavior and loan repayment patterns.
Generated strategic marketing recommendations based on customer segmentation to reduce churn and improve targeting.
